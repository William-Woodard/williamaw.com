										<h1>About</h1>
									</header>

									<p>
										At the age of nine I was given a Raspberry Pi and was first captivated by the ability to create small games and then electronic projects of gradually increasing complexity. Since then, I have developed my skills in these areas and also discovered and been fascinated by new engineering disciplines such as robotics, CAD with mechanical design, 3D printing, PCB design and woodwork.
										</p>
										<p>
										I discovered robotics in year 9 and led our team’s entry to ‘Pioneers’, a national digital making competition run by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. We made a Bluetooth controlled Nerf gun robot incorporating woodworking, coding, and electronics. As the winning team we were paid to show our project at the ‘Coolest Projects’ event at the Olympic Park. In 2019 we presented a climate change themed game in Dublin. Discussing the wide range of projects on display with both judges and contestants, I was able to see the almost unlimited routes I could pursue with engineering. My team also won Robocon, an autonomous robotics competition run by Hills Road Sixth Form College, where I had my first taste using high torque brushed DC motors with LiPo batteries. 
										</p>
										<p>
										
										I have assembled my own 3D printer enabling me to learn exactly how they work and to develop more design/mechanical skills whilst designing new parts to upgrade it. I taught myself how to use Fusion 360 so I can design parts to print and I have used the printer extensively – an example being designing and printing in PLA an alternator to generate electricity from rain water drainpipes for the Davidsons Inventers Challenge. My team received a special commendation. I wrote an ‘Instructables’ to share what we had learnt with this which has over 500 views. I also designed and developed an autonomous tennis ball collector machine for my EPQ project teaching me a wealth of transferrable skills. This gave me experience of project management, report writing and time management.
										</p>
										<p>
										
										This year I have become fascinated with developing PCBs, a process I taught myself while completing my Gold Level Industrial Cadets award. I have also considerably developed my coding skills taking part in Student Robotics (SR) where we coded autonomous robots. This entailed learning about PID tuning and state machines as well as coding productively in a team using github and pair programming. Now lead Hills Road Robotics, I look forward to guiding the design of our SR robot and running Robocon for GCSE students next year. We have already begun work designing the competition including the equipment we will give the students. Other coding experience includes the GCHQ Cyberfirst advanced course: a residential course where I learnt cyber security skills as well as coding my own portfolio website: williamaw.com. I see these activities along with my A level subjects (Physics, Double Maths and Chemistry) as a good foundation for a general engineering degree. I’m applying to do a year industry at Cambridge Consultants.
										</p>
										<p>
										
										Independently, I have done well in several “hackathons” including the international Astra Zeneca sustainability hackathon in which I led the team that designed a smart recycling bin winning overall to receive prizes worth £1400. I have developed software for a reading glove for the blind, worked with frequency modulation for a motion sensor alarm, designed a light sensitive plant pot, and utilised Twitter’s APIs to create a dog collar that tweets.
										</p>
										<p>
										
										My hobbies include sailing, DofE gold (150km canoeing in the Highlands), Scouts (Chief Scout award) and rowing. As a sculler I came 7th nationally in British Junior Championships in 2018. In 2021 I won blades in the first division of Bumps. I have been elected Hills Road Boys Captain for next year which should help me build the leadership, communication, and organisation skills needed to thrive as an engineer.
